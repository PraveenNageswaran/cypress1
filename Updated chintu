It seems like there's an issue with the method call `file.exists()` which is throwing a MissingMethodException. This usually happens when the method does not exist or there's an error in the way it's being called.

Let's try another approach using Groovy's `withReader` method to read the file line by line. Here's the modified code:

```groovy
def file = new File('/path/to/your/file') // Replace '/path/to/your/file' with the path to your file

// Check if the file exists
if (file.isFile()) {
    def username = null
    def password = null
    
    // Read the file line by line
    file.withReader { reader ->
        reader.eachLine { line ->
            // Check if the line contains 'User='
            if (line.startsWith('User=')) {
                // Extract the username
                username = line.substring(line.indexOf('=') + 1).trim()
            }
            // Check if the line contains 'Password='
            if (line.startsWith('Password=')) {
                // Extract the password
                password = line.substring(line.indexOf('=') + 1).trim()
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Print the extracted username and password
    println("Username: $username")
    println("Password: $password")
} else {
    println("File not found!")
}
```

This code should read the file line by line and extract the username and password accordingly. Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/file` with the actual path to your file.
