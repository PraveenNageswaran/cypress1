I see the issue. It seems that there was a typo in the previous code snippet, and I appreciate your patience. Let me correct that for you:

```groovy
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml

// Load the YAML file
def yaml = new Yaml()
def data = new File('/path/to/your/file.yaml').text
def parsedData = yaml.load(data)

// Write to CSV
def csvOutput = new StringWriter()
def headerWritten = false
parsedData.each { item ->
    if (!headerWritten){
        csvOutput.write(item.keySet().join(',') + '\n')
        headerWritten = true
    }
    csvOutput.write(item.values().join(',') + '\n')
}

// Save CSV to a file
new File('/path/to/output/file.csv').write(csvOutput.toString())
```

In this revised version:
- We use the `each` method to iterate through the parsed data.
- Within the loop, we check if the CSV header has been written, and if not, we write the keys from the first element as the header.
- Then, we write the values of each item as the data rows in the CSV file.

Please replace `'/path/to/your/file.yaml'` with the actual path to your YAML file, and `'/path/to/output/file.csv'` with the path where you want to save the CSV file.

I hope this revised script helps address the issue. If you encounter further challenges or have more questions, feel free to ask!
