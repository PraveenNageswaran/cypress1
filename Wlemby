Certainly! To store the JSON-like structure as a list in Groovy, you can directly define a list of maps.

```groovy
def myList = [
    [Fruit: 'apple'],
    [Fruit: 'pears'],
    [Fruit: 'mango'],
    [Veg: 'radish'],
    [Veg: 'pumpkin']
]

// Accessing elements in the list
myList.each { item ->
    item.each { key, value ->
        println("$key: $value")
    }
}
```

This `myList` variable is a list of maps where each map represents an item with the keys 'Fruit' or 'Veg' as described in your JSON-like structure. You can iterate through the list and access each element, then further iterate through each map to access its key-value pairs.
