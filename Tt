I see, it seems the pattern needs further refinement. To capture characters after the comma and stop just before encountering `]`, a double space, or any other string specifically excluding these conditions, try this pattern:

```regex
Replace:(?:[^], ]|](?![^\[\]]*),|\s{2,}(?![^ ])|[^,])*?,\s*(.*)
```

This pattern aims to capture characters after the comma, excluding occurrences of `]`, a double space (`  `), or any other string specifically by considering these conditions and stopping just before encountering them.
