Apologies for the confusion. Let's refine the pattern further to ensure it stops just before encountering `]`, a double space, or any other string without including it:

```regex
Replace:(?:.(?![\], Understood! If you want to capture characters after the comma and stop just before encountering `]`, a double space, or any other string, you can use this adjusted pattern:

```regex
Replace:(?:[^], ]|(?=]|\s\s|[^,]))*?,\s*(.*)
```

This pattern will capture characters after the comma and stop just before encountering `]`, a double space (`  `), or any other string while excluding them from the captured text.))*?,\s*(.*)
```

This pattern should skip characters between "Replace:" and just before encountering `]`, a double space (`  `), or any other string, and then capture all characters after the comma, including any leading whitespace after the comma.
