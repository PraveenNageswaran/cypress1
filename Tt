Certainly! To ignore characters between "Replace:" and either `]`, a double space, or any other string until right before it (not including it) and then capture all characters after the comma, you can use this pattern:

```regex
Replace:.*?(?=]|  |[^,]*),\s*(.*)
```

This pattern will ignore everything from "Replace:" until it reaches `]`, a double space (`  `), or any other string (denoted by `[^,]*`) just before the comma (but not including it). Then it captures all characters after the comma, including any leading whitespace after the comma.
