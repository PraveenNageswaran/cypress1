To rename a file to a `.txt` format within the context of iterating over files in a Groovy script, you can leverage the `renameTo` method of the `File` class. This method allows you to rename a file or move it to a different directory. When you want to change the file extension to `.txt`, you essentially keep the original file name but replace its extension.

Here’s how you can incorporate the renaming process into your Groovy script:

```groovy
// Specify the directory
def dir = new File("/path/to/your/directory")

// Ensure the path exists and is a directory
if (dir.exists() && dir.isDirectory()) {
    // List all files (excluding directories) in the specified directory
    dir.listFiles().findAll { it.isFile() }.each { file ->
        // Define a new file name with the .txt extension
        def newName = file.name.lastIndexOf('.').with { it != -1 ? file.name[0..it-1] : file.name } + ".txt"
        // Create a File object for the new path
        def newFile = new File(file.parent, newName)
        // Rename the file
        if (file.renameTo(newFile)) {
            println "Renamed ${file.name} to ${newName}"
        } else {
            println "Failed to rename ${file.name}"
        }
    }
}
```

Let's break this down:
- First, you ensure that the directory exists and is indeed a directory.
- You then use `listFiles()` to get an array of `File` objects representing the files in the directory, filtering out directories with `findAll { it.isFile() }`.
- For each file found, you generate a new name with the `.txt` extension. The `lastIndexOf('.')` method finds the position of the last period in the file name, which is presumed to be the start of the file extension. This position is used to extract only the file name (excluding its extension) and then append `.txt` to it.
- A new `File` object is created for the renamed file, using the same parent directory and the new name.
- The `renameTo` method is called to rename the original file. It returns `true` if the renaming was successful and `false` otherwise.

This script will work efficiently for renaming files to have a `.txt` extension, but be aware that it overwrites the original files’ extensions without checking if they already are `.txt`. If maintaining original `.txt` files or avoiding overwriting is a concern, you might want to add a condition to check the current extension before renaming.
