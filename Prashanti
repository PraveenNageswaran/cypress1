I see the issue. It appears that the `toMap()` method might not be directly available for the data retrieved from the JMeter variables as it would be for a standard `List` of `Map` instances. We can work around this by constructing the list of maps by iterating through the data retrieved from the JMeter variables.

Here's an updated example using iteration to construct the list of maps from the retrieved data:

```groovy
// Retrieve the results from the JDBC Request samplers
def employeesData = vars.getObject("employees_result");
def tempEmployeesData = vars.getObject("temp_employees_result");

// Convert the result sets to lists of maps
def employeesList = resultSetToList(employeesData)
def tempEmployeesList = resultSetToList(tempEmployeesData)

// Define a method to convert ResultSet data to a list of maps
List<Map<String, Object>> resultSetToList(Object resultSetData) {
    def rows = []
    for (def row : resultSetData) {
        def rowData = [:]
        for (def columnName : row.keySet()) {
            rowData.put(columnName, row.get(columnName))
        }
        rows.add(rowData)
    }
    return rows
}

// Compare the data and print the results
def matchingRows = employeesList.intersect(tempEmployeesList)
def mismatchingRows = employeesList - tempEmployeesList + tempEmployeesList - employeesList

log.info("Matching Rows:")
matchingRows.each { row ->
    log.info(row)
}

log.info("Mismatching Rows:")
mismatchingRows.each { row ->
    log.info(row)
}
```

In this script, I've defined the `resultSetToList` method to iterate through the data retrieved from the JMeter variables and construct a list of maps. This list of maps is then used for comparison and logging of matching and mismatching rows.

I understand that the process of retrieving and manipulating the result data from JMeter variables in Groovy scripts can be challenging. Please let me know if you encounter any further issues or if there's anything else you need assistance with.
