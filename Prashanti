To achieve this in JMeter, you can use the JDBC Request sampler to fetch data from the two Oracle tables, and then use the JSR223 Sampler with Groovy to compare the data and print the mismatched rows. Here's a step-by-step guide to accomplishing this:

1. Configuring JDBC Connection:
   - Add a JDBC Connection Configuration element to your test plan.
   - Configure the necessary settings for connecting to your Oracle database (e.g., URL, driver class, username, password).

2. Adding JDBC Request samplers:
   - Add two JDBC Request samplers to your test plan, one for each table (TableA and TableB).
   - Configure each JDBC Request sampler to execute a query that retrieves the data from the respective tables.
   - For example, the SQL query for fetching data from TableA might look like: `SELECT * FROM TableA`

3. Adding JSR223 Sampler for comparison:
   - Add a JSR223 Sampler to your test plan after the JDBC Request samplers.
   - Choose "groovy" as the scripting language for the JSR223 sampler.

4. Writing Groovy script to compare and print mismatched rows:
   - Inside the JSR223 Sampler, you can use Groovy to compare the data fetched from the two tables.
   - The script can iterate through the result sets obtained from the JDBC Request samplers and compare the rows to identify any mismatches.
   - Here's a sample Groovy script that demonstrates the comparison:

```groovy
// Retrieve the result sets from the JDBC Request samplers
def resultTableA = vars.getObject("resultset_1")  // Assuming the result set from TableA is stored in "resultset_1"
def resultTableB = vars.getObject("resultset_2")  // Assuming the result set from TableB is stored in "resultset_2"

// Initialize lists to store mismatched rows
def mismatchedRowsInA = []
def mismatchedRowsInB = []

// Compare the rows and identify the mismatches
while (resultTableA.next() && resultTableB.next()) {
    def idA = resultTableA.getString("id")  // Assuming "id" is the primary key column
    def idB = resultTableB.getString("id")  // Assuming "id" is the primary key column

    if (idA != idB) {
        mismatchedRowsInA.add(idA)
        mismatchedRowsInB.add(idB)
    }
}

// Print the mismatched rows
log.info("Mismatched rows in TableA: ${mismatchedRowsInA}")
log.info("Mismatched rows in TableB: ${mismatchedRowsInB}")
```

5. Validating and running the test plan:
   - After adding the JSR223 Sampler with the Groovy script, validate the test plan configuration to ensure that there are no errors.
   - Run the test plan to execute the JDBC requests, perform the data comparison, and print the mismatched rows.

Please make sure to update the script according to the actual column names and data types in your tables. Additionally, be cautious with memory usage when working with large result sets, as loading large datasets into memory could affect JMeter's performance.
