Sure, to print the maximum length of the CSV file in the JMeter log, you can modify the previous Groovy script in the JSR223 Sampler as follows:

```groovy
def max_length = 0

new File('path/to/your/file.csv').eachLine { line ->
    if (line.length() > max_length) {
        max_length = line.length()
    }
}

log.info("Maximum length of the CSV file: " + max_length)
vars.put('max_length', max_length.toString())
```

This script not only stores the maximum length in the JMeter variable `max_length` but also logs the maximum length to the JMeter log using `log.info()`.

Replace `'path/to/your/file.csv'` with the actual path to your CSV file. This modification will log the maximum length of the CSV file during the JMeter test run.
