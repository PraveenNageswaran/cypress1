To count the total number of rows in a CSV file in JMeter using a Groovy script within a JSR223 Sampler, you can employ the following approach:

```groovy
File csvFile = new File('path/to/your/file.csv')
int rowCount = 0

csvFile.eachLine { line ->
    // Increment the row count for each line read
    rowCount++
}

log.info("Total number of rows in the CSV file: ${rowCount}")

// Store the row count in a JMeter variable if needed
vars.put('total_row_count', String.valueOf(rowCount))
```

Replace `'path/to/your/file.csv'` with the actual path to your CSV file.

This script iterates through each line of the CSV file and increments the `rowCount` variable for each line, effectively counting the number of rows in the file. The total row count is then logged, and you can store it in a JMeter variable (`total_row_count`) for further use within your test plan. Adjust the script as per your requirements.
