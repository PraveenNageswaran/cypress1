To retrieve the length of each row in a CSV file within JMeter, you can utilize a Groovy script within a JSR223 Sampler. This script reads the CSV file, splits each line into rows, and calculates the length of each row. Here's an example:

```groovy
File csvFile = new File('path/to/your/file.csv')
List<String> rowLengths = []

csvFile.eachLine { line ->
    // Calculate the length of each row and store it in the rowLengths list
    rowLengths.add(line.length().toString())
}

// Join the row lengths into a single string for easier printing or further use
String allRowLengths = rowLengths.join(',')

// Log the lengths of each row
log.info("Lengths of each row: ${allRowLengths}")

// Store the row lengths in a JMeter variable if needed
vars.put('row_lengths', allRowLengths)
```

Replace `'path/to/your/file.csv'` with the actual path to your CSV file.

This script reads each line of the CSV file, calculates the length of each line (row), stores the lengths in a list, and logs the lengths as a comma-separated string. You can also store the row lengths in a JMeter variable `row_lengths` for further use in your test plan. Adjust the script according to your specific needs.
