It seems that the 400 Bad Request error with the message "at least one file must be attached" indicates that the Confluence REST API is expecting a file to be attached, but the request does not contain the necessary file attachment. To resolve this issue, you can adjust the script to include the file attachment in the request. Here's how you can modify the script to ensure that a file is attached to the request:

```groovy
import org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.sampler.HTTPSamplerProxy
import org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.control.Header
import org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.control.HeaderManager
import org.apache.jmeter.config.Arguments
import org.apache.jmeter.testelement.property.CollectionProperty
import org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.HTTPFileArg
import org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.util.HTTPFileArgs

// Request URL
def baseUrl = "http://your-confluence-instance-url/rest/api/content/{pageID}/child/attachment"

// Create HTTPSamplerProxy
def httpSampler = new HTTPSamplerProxy()
httpSampler.setDomain("your-confluence-instance-url")
httpSampler.setPort(80)
httpSampler.setPath("/rest/api/content/{pageID}/child/attachment")
httpSampler.setMethod("POST")

// Construct the Request Body
def boundary = "----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW"
def fileName = "your-file-name.txt"
def fileParameterName = "file"
def fileContentType = "text/plain"

def fileContent = new File("path-to-your-file/your-file-name.txt").bytes

def requestBody = "--" + boundary + "\r\n"
requestBody += "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"" + fileParameterName + "\"; filename=\"" + fileName + "\"\r\n"
requestBody += "Content-Type: " + fileContentType + "\r\n\r\n"
requestBody += new String(fileContent) + "\r\n"
requestBody += "--" + boundary + "--\r\n"

// Set request body
httpSampler.setPostBodyRaw(true)
httpSampler.addNonEncodedArgument("", requestBody, "")

// Set Headers
def headers = new HeaderManager()
headers.add(new Header("Content-Type", "multipart/form-data; boundary=" + boundary))
httpSampler.setHeaderManager(headers)

// Execute the HTTPSamplerProxy
result = httpSampler.sample()
```

Ensure that you replace `your-confluence-instance-url`, `{pageID}`, and `path-to-your-file/your-file-name.txt` with your actual Confluence instance URL, the page ID where you want to upload the file, and the path to the file you want to attach. After making these modifications, re-run the JMeter test to ensure that the file attachment is included in the request and that the 400 Bad Request error is resolved.

By ensuring that the file attachment is properly included in the request, you can address the "at least one file must be attached" error from the Confluence REST API.
