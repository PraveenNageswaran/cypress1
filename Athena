If your AWS access key and secret key are stored in the `.aws` folder, you can still dynamically retrieve these credentials and use them in your JMeter test plan. However, it's important to ensure that you handle these credentials securely and avoid exposing them unnecessarily within your test configurations.

Here's a high-level approach to leverage the AWS credentials stored in the `.aws` folder within your JMeter test plan:

1. **Use AWS CLI Profile:**
   If you have configured the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) with named profiles and stored your AWS credentials in the `.aws` folder, you can leverage the AWS credentials provider chain to automatically use the credentials from your named profile when running your JMeter test plan.

2. **Configure AWS Credential Provider in JMeter:**
   When using the JDBC Request sampler in JMeter to connect to Amazon Athena, you can set the `aws_credentials_provider_class` parameter in the JDBC URL to `com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider` and specify the AWS profile name to use.

   Example:
   Assuming you have a named profile called `myprofile` in your AWS credentials file (`.aws/credentials`), you can specify the profile name in the JDBC URL as follows:

   ```
   jdbc:awsathena://athena.<REGION>.amazonaws.com:443/<DATABASE_NAME>?aws_credentials_provider_class=com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider&aws_credentials_provider_arguments=myprofile
   ```

3. **Security Considerations:**
   It's important to emphasize the security implications of using credentials from the `.aws` folder within your JMeter test plan. Ensure that you follow best practices for securing your test environment, such as restricting access to the test configurations and results, and considering the implications of using real production credentials in test environments.

4. **Refreshing Credentials:**
   If your AWS credentials in the `.aws` folder are configured to automatically refresh (for example, using credentials with limited lifespan or assuming IAM roles), be aware of how this automatic refresh behavior might impact your JMeter test execution. In such cases, ensure that your test plan can handle dynamic credential updates gracefully.

By leveraging the AWS credentials stored in the `.aws` folder and configuring the AWS credentials provider in JMeter, you can use these credentials within your test plan without hard-coding them directly.

Remember to exercise caution and follow security best practices when handling credentials in any environment, including your testing environment.
