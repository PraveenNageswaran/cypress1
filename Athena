When using the JDBC Request sampler in JMeter to connect to Amazon Athena, you'll also need to specify the database name as part of the JDBC URL. Amazon Athena does not require you to specify a specific database name in the traditional sense as it deals with schemaless data and tables in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

However, you can still use the JDBC URL to connect to Athena, and you can specify the default catalog and workgroup within the JDBC URL.

Here's an example of how to include the database name, default catalog, and workgroup when using the JDBC URL for Amazon Athena in JMeter's JDBC Request sampler:

```plain
jdbc:awsathena://athena.{region}.amazonaws.com:443/?aws_credentials_provider_class=com.amazonaws.auth.DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain;S3OutputLocation=s3://your-bucket/path/to/query-results;Workgroup=your-workgroup;Schema=your-database
```

In the above JDBC URL:

- `{region}` should be replaced with the appropriate AWS region for your Amazon Athena setup.
- `aws_credentials_provider_class` parameter sets the AWS credentials provider class.
- `S3OutputLocation` specifies the location in Amazon S3 where query results are stored.
- `Workgroup` specifies the workgroup name for Athena.
- `Schema` specifies the default database (catalog) name to use for the connection.

Replace `your-bucket`, `your-path`, `your-workgroup`, and `your-database` with the actual values specific to your Amazon Athena environment.

By including the database name and other necessary details in the JDBC URL, you can configure the JDBC Request sampler in JMeter to connect to Amazon Athena with the appropriate settings.
