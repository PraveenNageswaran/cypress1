If the table sizes can be different, you can modify the JSR223 Groovy script to compare the tables based on a specific key, such as a primary key or any unique identifier present in both tables. Here's a revised approach that accommodates tables of different sizes:

```groovy
def tableA = vars.getObject("tableA"); // Retrieve the result set for table A from JMeter variables
def tableB = vars.getObject("tableB"); // Retrieve the result set for table B from JMeter variables

for (int i = 0; i < tableA.size(); i++) { 
    def rowA = tableA.get(i); // Get the current row from table A
    def rowB = findMatch(tableB, rowA); // Attempt to find a matching row in table B

    if (rowB != null) { // A match is found in table B
        log.info("Row " + i + " - Matched");
        log.info("Row A: " + rowA);
        log.info("Row B: " + rowB);
    } else { // No matching row found in table B
        log.info("Row " + i + " from table A has no match in table B");
        log.info("Row A: " + rowA);
    }
}

// Function to find a matching row in table B based on a key or identifier
def findMatch(tableB, rowA) {
    for (def row : tableB) {
        if (row.toString() == rowA.toString()) { // Compare the rows
            return row; // Return the matching row
        }
    }
    return null; // If no match is found
}
```

In this revised script, when comparing the tables, each row from table A is matched against the rows in table B using the `findMatch` function. If a matching row is found in table B, it is logged as a match, and if no matching row is found, it is logged as such. This allows for comparisons between tables of different sizes by looking for matches based on their content rather than strictly by position.

Please ensure that you have the necessary error handling and data validation in your test plan to accommodate different table sizes and potential null values.
