Question 
in jsr223 sampler
Hello AI
Certainly! If you want to create a page in Confluence using the JSR223 Sampler in JMeter, you can use the following steps:

1. Add a JSR223 Sampler: In your JMeter test plan, add a JSR223 Sampler to the thread group where you want to create the page.

2. Choose the scripting language: In the JSR223 Sampler, select the scripting language as "groovy" since it is commonly used with JMeter.

3. Import necessary libraries: Import the required libraries to make HTTP requests. In this case, you can use the `HTTPBuilder` library.

4. Write the Groovy code: Inside the JSR223 Sampler, write the Groovy code to create the page using the Confluence REST API. Here's an example:

```groovy
import groovy.json.JsonOutput
import groovyx.net.http.HTTPBuilder

def username = 'pinky@dinky.com'
def password = 'donkey'
def proxyHost = 'http://usrgrp.net
'
def proxyPort = 8080
def proxyUsername = 'pinky'
def proxyPassword = 'password123$'

def pageData = [
    type: 'page',
    title: 'My New Page',
    space: [
        key: 'SPACE_KEY'
    ],
    body: [
        storage: [
            value: '<p>This is the content of my new page.</p>',
            representation: 'storage'
        ]
    ]
]

def confluenceUrl = 'https://your-confluence-instance/rest/api/content'

def http = new HTTPBuilder(confluenceUrl)
http.auth.basic(username, password)
http.proxy.host = proxyHost
http.proxy.port = proxyPort
http.proxy.auth.basic(proxyUsername, proxyPassword)

http.request(Method.POST, ContentType.JSON) {
    uri.path = '/rest/api/content'
    body = JsonOutput.toJson(pageData)

    response.success = { resp, json ->
        log.info("Page created successfully: ${json}")
    }

    response.failure = { resp, json ->
        log.error("Error creating page: ${json}")
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace `'SPACE_KEY'` with the actual space key where you want to create the page. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies, such as the `HTTPBuilder` library, in your JMeter installation.

Feel free to customize the code according to your specific requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions! ðŸ˜Š
