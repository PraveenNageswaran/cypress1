I understand that you want to ensure that all the fields from your YAML file are mapped to the corresponding headers in the CSV output. In the previous example, I provided a basic mapping for specific fields, but now, we'll aim to dynamically map all the fields from the YAML file to the CSV headers. Here's a modified example in Groovy that achieves this:

```groovy
@Grapes([
    @Grab('org.yaml:snakeyaml:1.29')
])

import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml
import java.util.stream.Collectors

// Read the YAML file
def yaml = new Yaml()
def data = new File('your_yaml_file.yaml').text
def parsedData = yaml.load(data)

// Extract all unique keys from the YAML structure
def allKeys = parsedData.paths.collectMany { path, details ->
    details.collectMany { operation, info ->
        info.parameters?.collectMany { parameter ->
            parameter.keySet()
        }
    }
}.flatten().unique()

// Write the CSV data to a file
new File('output.csv').withWriter { writer ->
    writer.write allKeys.join(',') + '\n'
    
    parsedData.paths.each { path, details ->
        details.each { operation, info ->
            info.parameters?.each { parameter ->
                def line = allKeys.collect { key ->
                    parameter.containsKey(key) ? "\"${parameter[key]}\"" : ''
                }.join(',')
                writer.write "${line}\n"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated script, it identifies all the unique keys from the YAML structure and uses them as the headers for the CSV file. It then loops through the YAML data to construct the CSV rows by mapping each field value to the appropriate header. Finally, it writes the CSV data to a file named `output.csv`.

By using this approach, the script dynamically handles all the fields present in the YAML file, ensuring that they are appropriately mapped to the corresponding headers in the CSV output.

Feel free to adjust the script as per your specific requirements or if you need further assistance!
