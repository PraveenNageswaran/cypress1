It looks like you are trying to perform a specific technical task involving the Confluence REST API and a JSR223 sampler. This is a complex and detailed topic that may require a deep technical understanding.

To achieve this task, you can use the following steps as a general guide:

Step 1: Sending a request to Confluence using HTTP Request Sampler
You can use the HTTP Request sampler to send a request to the Confluence REST API endpoint. Make sure to set the appropriate method (e.g., POST) and include the necessary headers (e.g., Content-Type, Authorization).

Step 2: Attach a JSON file using JSR223 Sampler
To attach a JSON file, you can use the JSR223 Sampler with a scripting language such as Groovy or JavaScript. Within the script, you will need to perform the following tasks:
- Read the JSON file from your local filesystem
- Encode the content of the JSON file
- Include the encoded content in the request to Confluence


Here's an example of how you might approach this task using Groovy in a JSR223 Sampler:

```groovy
import org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.control.Header
import org.apache.jorphan.util.JOrphanUtils

// Read the JSON file
def filePath = '/path/to/your/json/file.json'
def jsonContent = new File(filePath).text

// Encode the JSON content
def encodedContent = JOrphanUtils.baToHexString(jsonContent.bytes)

// Set the request parameters
sampler.addNonEncodedArgument("file", encodedContent, "")
sampler.setPostBodyRaw(true)

// Add the necessary headers
sampler.getHeaderManager().add(new Header("Content-Type", "application/json"))

// Make the request to Confluence
sampler.sample(null)
```

In this example, you would replace "/path/to/your/json/file.json" with the actual path to your JSON file.

Please note that the specific implementation details may vary based on your JMeter setup and the exact requirements of your Confluence integration. Additionally, the handling of sensitive information such as usernames and passwords should be done with care, ensuring that proper security measures are in place.
