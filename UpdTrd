It looks like the code you've provided is for a JMeter script that makes an HTTP POST request to upload a file to a Confluence page as an attachment. However, it seems that there might be some issues with the casting and the implementation of the HTTP request.

It looks like you're trying to set up the HTTP request sampler with the necessary parameters such as the domain, path, method, and file attachment. However, the casting of the HTTPFileArgs might be causing an issue.

Instead of using `httpSampler.setArguments(new HTTPFileArgs(new HTTPFileArg(attachmentFilePath, "file", "application/octet-stream")));`, you should use the following approach to set the file as part of the request:

```java
HTTPSamplerProxy httpSampler = new HTTPSamplerProxy();
httpSampler.setDomain(confluenceUrl);
httpSampler.setPath(confluenceUrl.replace("{id}", pageId));
httpSampler.setMethod("POST");

httpSampler.setHTTPFiles(new HTTPFileArg(attachmentFilePath, "file", "application/octet-stream"));

// Rest of the code remains the same
```

Additionally, it seems that you're trying to create a custom Authorization implementation, but it's not clear whether this is necessary for your scenario.

You can add the Authorization header directly to the HTTP request sampler using:

```java
httpSampler.setHeaderManager(new HeaderManager() {{
    add(new Header("Authorization", "Basic " + JOrphanUtils.base64Encode(username + ":" + password)));
}});
```

Make sure to replace `username` and `password` with your actual credentials.

Finally, after setting up the HTTP request sampler, you can add it to a Thread Group and run the JMeter script to upload the file to the Confluence page as an attachment.
