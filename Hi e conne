When connecting to Hive using Kerberos authentication in JMeter, you typically need to provide the CoreSite configuration and the HDFS site configuration to enable secure communication. Here's how you can include both configurations in your JMeter script:

1. **CoreSite Configuration**: The `core-site.xml` file contains configuration settings for Hadoop Core services. You need to specify the path to this file in your JMeter script to enable the connection to Hadoop services like HDFS. The CoreSite configuration is crucial for authenticating with Kerberos and accessing HDFS.

2. **HDFS Site Configuration**: The `hdfs-site.xml` file contains configuration settings specific to the HDFS service. While it's essential for HDFS operations, including it in the JMeter script might not be necessary for connecting to Hive. However, having it available can ensure that your connection to Hive understands the HDFS settings if needed.

Here is a modified example of a Groovy script in JMeter that includes both CoreSite and HDFS site configurations for connecting to Hive using Kerberos authentication:

```groovy
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.Statement;
import java.util.Properties;
import org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation;
import java.io.File;

// Hive JDBC connection properties
def hiveUrl = "jdbc:hive2://your-hive-server:10000/default";
def principal = "your-service-principal@YOUR-REALM.COM";
def keytabLocation = "/path/to/your/keytab/file.keytab";
def coreSitePath = "/path/to/your/core-site.xml";
def hdfsSitePath = "/path/to/your/hdfs-site.xml";
def krb5ConfPath = "/path/to/your/krb5.conf";

// Load CoreSite and HDFS Site configurations
def coreSite = new File(coreSitePath).text;
def hdfsSite = new File(hdfsSitePath).text;

System.setProperty("java.security.auth.login.config", krb5ConfPath);
System.setProperty("javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly", "false");
System.setProperty("java.security.krb5.conf", krb5ConfPath);
Properties props = new Properties();
props.setProperty("core-site.xml", coreSite);
props.setProperty("hdfs-site.xml", hdfsSite);

// Login with Kerberos keytab
UserGroupInformation.setConfiguration(props);
UserGroupInformation.loginUserFromKeytab(principal, keytabLocation);

// Connect to Hive
Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(hiveUrl, props);

// Create a statement
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();

// Execute a sample query
String query = "SELECT * FROM your_table";
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);

// Output the results
while (resultSet.next()) {
    log.info(resultSet.getString(1)); // Modify this line based on your query result structure
}

// Close resources
resultSet.close();
statement.close();
connection.close();
```

In this script:

1. Specify the paths to both the `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml` files.
2. Load the CoreSite and HDFS Site configurations into the `props` Properties object.
3. Pass the `props` object to the `getConnection` method to ensure both configurations are used during the connection.
4. Adapt the script as needed to handle any specific requirements for your Hive connection setup.

By including both the CoreSite and HDFS Site configurations in your JMeter script, you can ensure that your connection to Hive is properly authenticated with Kerberos and interacts securely with the required Hadoop services.
